If we reverse the given text

    ,6u!tvtor, s! r3msuv 3HT

we get the following

    TH3 vusm3r !s ,rotvt!u6, 

we can assume that the first word is "the" and the third is "is" so we replace every letter and we get
   
    T -> t, H -> h, 3 -> e, ! -> i
    the vusmer is ,rotvtiu6,

we can assume that the second word is "answer" so we replace the letters

    v -> a, u -> n, m -> w
    the answer is ,rotatin6,

and with the hint from the challenge's name "iPod" we get

    the answer is ,rotating,
