We download the image and open it with gimp and adjust the colors
right click -> Colors -> Adjust Color Balance ->
Uncheck "Preserve luminosity" ->
Midtones (Red -100, Green -100, Blue 0) ->
Highlights (Red 0, Green -100, Blue -100)

and we can see the text clearly, at the bottom it says
Password: HAL9000
